# Project Overview

GEC is a secure PC time management system designed for environments where shared computer access must be controlled, fair, and secure.

The project focuses on:
- Educational institutions
- Libraries
- Community learning centers
- Workforce training facilities

The system provides administrators with full control over computer usage while ensuring a simple, user-friendly experience for clients.
