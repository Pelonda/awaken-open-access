## Overview
GEC Open Access is a secure computer time-management system designed for
schools, libraries, and community learning centers.

The system enables institutions to provide controlled, equitable access to
shared computers while ensuring security, accountability, and efficient use
of public resources.

This project is offered **free of charge** for educational and public
institutions.
