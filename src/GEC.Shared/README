# GEC.Shared (Shared Core Library)

This project contains the shared data layer used by both **GEC.Server** and **GEC.Client**.

## Contains
- Entity models (Computer, Session, AdminUser, AppSetting)
- Database context (CafeContext) using Entity Framework Core
- Shared enums and helpers
- Security utilities (password hashing, validation)

## Why it exists
Keeping all database models in one place ensures:
- consistent schema across server and client
- fewer breaking changes
- easier migration to the future Awaken platform
